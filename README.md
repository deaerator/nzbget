nzbget
======

Compiled binaries for running NZBGet on Linux AMD64 (x86_64).

This is initially being created to allow for automated updating of NZBGet on Asustor, by using a git pull on each package start.

I will try and keep both the stable (Master branch) and and major testing (Testing branch) releases updated as HugBug makes new releases.

For other NZBGet installation options, and support, please visit the main NZBGet page. http://nzbget.sourceforge.net/Main_Page
