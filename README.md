nzbget
======

Compiled binaries for running NZBGet on Linux 32 (i386).

This is initially being created to allow for automated updating of NZBGet on Asustor, by using a git pull on each package start.

I will try and keep both the stable (Master-32 branch) and and major testing (Testing-32 branch) releases updated as HugBug makes new releases.

For other NZBGet installation options, and support, please visit the main NZBGet page. http://nzbget.sourceforge.net/Main_Page
